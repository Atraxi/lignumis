This mod extends the early game of Space Age by putting you on the moon "Lignumis" before you escape to Nauvis. It concentrates on wood and steam technologies, giving you some early game production chains for those resources.

The duration of the stay on Lignumis will be rather short. The impact of the later game will still be substantial (once implemented).

## Alpha version

This is a very early version of the mod. It contains the complete idea of the moon from beginning to end but still needs a lot of features and polishing. Also end-game content and a reason to come back are still missing but are planned.

To not hinder development, I will not be considerate about breaking changes until I switch the status to "Beta".

If you like to contribute in any way, feel free to contact me.
