This mod extends the early game of Space Age by putting you on the moon "Lignumis" before you escape to Nauvis. It concentrates on wood and steam technologies, giving you some early game production chains for those resources.

The duration of the stay on Lignumis will be rather short. The impact of the later game will still be substantial (once implemented).

## Beta version

This is an early version of the mod. It contains all the content that was originally planned but still needs some balancing and polishing.

**Please help me finish this mod by giving me feedback of any kind (e.g. odd, missing or broken things, ideas to improve mechanics or progression or anything else that comes to your mind).**

If you like to contribute in any other way, feel free to contact me as well.

## Mod recommendations

The following mods can be a great addition for this mod:

### [Burner Leech Fork](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/Burner-Leech-Fork)

There will be fewer inserters that need to be fueled manually.

### [Hot metals](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/hot-metals)

If you like the idea that metals need to cool down after being smolten in a furnace, Lignumis gold has support for hot metals.

### [Wooden Military](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/wood-military)

If you want more of it than Lignumis offers, add this mod. It adds ammo for shotguns and there are settings for rockets and artillery shells.

### [Wooden Industry](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/wood-industry)

If you like go more into the charcoal direction. It has no overlap with Lignumis and starts to get relevant on Nauvis.

### [Fulgora: Coralmium Agriculture](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/fulgora-coralmium-agriculture) and [Wooden Vulcanus: Sulfuric Bacteria](https://mods.factorio.com/mod/vulcanus-sulfuric-bacteria)

For wood on the other planets.
