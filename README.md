This mod extends the early game of Space Age by putting you on the moon "Lignumis" before you escape to Nauvis. It concentrates on wood and steam technologies, giving you some early game production chains for those resources.

The duration of the stay on Lignumis will be rather short. The impact of the later game will still be substantial (once implemented).

## Beta version

This is an early version of the mod. It contains all the content that was originally planned but still needs some balancing and polishing.

**Please help me finish this mod by giving me feedback of any kind (e.g. odd, missing or broken things, ideas to improve mechanics or progression or anything else that comes to your mind).**

If you like to contribute in any other way, feel free to contact me as well.
